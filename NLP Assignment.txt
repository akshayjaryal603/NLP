Question
You need to construct an unigram inverted index on the dataset given here
Do complete preprocessing of data : Stop word removal, tokenisation etc. You may use libraries for it but
clearly state your assumptions.
Construct a word cloud of the complete dataset.
You need to build a CLI which supports following queries
1) x OR y
2) x AND y
3) x AND NOT y
4) x OR NOT y
Where x and y would be taken as input from the user
For query processing, You need to implement
- Merge postings algorithm
- Skip pointers algorithm (only for x AND y)
Analyse how the variation in number of skips affects the performance of your system and write in the
report.
